Emilia Jarochowska and Wilma Wessels (Utrecht University)

This is an example rubric for an exercise worth (an arbitrary number of)
10 points.

<td>Analysis and visualisation</td>
<td>No or missing plots, plots showing incorrect information</td>
<td>Plots showing correct information but not formatted correctly (no or
wrong axis labels or legends), only part of the plots produced</td>
<td>All plots showing correct information and formatted correctly, axes
and legends complete and correct</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>Code and reproducibility</td>
<td>Code missing or not executable, e.g. paths to files are missing or
wrong, operations on objects that had not been created</td>
<td>Code executable but does not satisfy the instructions,
e.g. incorrect format, no documentation, redundant or unnecessary
commands</td>
<td>The code can be executed and allows reproducing the analysis. It is
integrated with the explanations and follows the instructions concerning
formatting.</td>
<td>3</td>

<td>Final report</td>
<td><p>Report missing</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Report lacking conclusions</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Report not based on the analysis</p></td>
<td><p>The text integrates information from the analysis and refers to
the figures so a reader can follow the reasoning and the interpretation
of the changes in the environment.</p>
<p>It provides conclusions on climate changes since the Pleistocene in
the studied area.</p></td>
