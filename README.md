# Reconstruction of Pleistocene climate based on assemblages of mammal microfossis from a cave in Hungary

Target audience: University students (BSc, MSc), interested laypeople, scientists from other fields

Disciplines: Earth sciences, geoscience, environmental science

### Contents of the repo

-   `Instructions.md` - Instructions file which you can preview directly on GitHub
-   `Instructions.qmd` - Markup file used to generate `Instructions.md`, can be rendered to other formats (see below)
-   `Rubric.qmd` and `Rubric.md` - example grading rubric (source and output, respectively)
-   `data` - Files needed to complete the exercise
-   `solutions` - Example solutions and data needed to generate them
    -   `solutions/R_solution.md` - Example solution in R
    -   `solutions/R_solution.qmd` - Code for the example solution, prepared using R 4.3.1
-   `solutions/data` - Data needed to generate the solutions, otherwise would have been generated by the students during the exercise.

### How to use the contents?

The instruction is provided in the `Instructions.qmd` [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) file. This is an open source publishing format based on markdown. You can preview the file in `Instructions.md` file in the same repository. Quarto files can be rendered to any format: `docx`, `pdf`, `html`.

You can render the file in two ways. First, clone the repository.

1.  Open the file in R Studio, set the following line to your preferred format, e.g.:

```         
format: pdf
```

And click `Render`.

2.  Change the line as above using any text editor and use Quarto CLI to render it:

```         
quarto render
```

The exercise can be completed in any reactive language that allows data manipulation and plotting: R, Python, Julia, etc.

### TODO list:

-   Provide solutions for Python (needs writing from scratch)
