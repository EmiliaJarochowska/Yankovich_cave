# Reconstruction of Pleistocene climate based on assemblages of mammal microfossis from a cave in Hungary

Target audience: University students (BSc, MSc) with basic skills (input/output, plotting, data manipulation) in a reactive scripting language such as R or Python. The module was originally developed for a course in Paleontology in the BSc in Geosciences programme at Utrecht University and taught in R. The level of difficulty can be lowered by providing part of the codes for the solution (included in the repository) to students.

Disciplines: Earth sciences, geoscience, environmental science

## Contents
This repository contains source files (see below under file formats) and has a Zenodo equivalent where `html` files are included.

-   `Instructions.md` - Instructions file which you can preview directly on GitHub
-   `Instructions.qmd` - Markup file used to generate `Instructions.md`, can be rendered to other formats (see below)
-   `Rubric.qmd` and `Rubric.md` - example grading rubric (source and output, respectively)
-   `data` - Files needed to complete the exercise, extraced from figures in the article by Kretzoi (1957)
    -   Table2.csv - counts of fossil voles per bed and absolute age of each bed
    -   Table4.csv - counts of non-vole fossil vertebrates per bed and absolute age of each bed
-   `solutions` - Example solutions and data needed to generate them
    -   `solutions/R_solution.md` - Example solution in R
    -   `solutions/R_solution.qmd` - Code for the example solution, prepared using R 4.3.1
-   `solutions/data` - Data needed to generate the solutions, otherwise would have been generated by the students during the exercise.

The exercise can be completed in any reactive language that allows data manipulation and plotting: R, Python, Julia, etc.

### File formats and editing
Text and presentation files are provided as [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) files. This is an open source publishing format based on markdown. Quarto files can be edited using text editors and IDEs such as R Studio and rendered to any format: `docx`, `pdf`, `html`. You can preview the contents of the OER directly on GitHub in files with `.md` extension and `.html` files are provided in the Zenodo repository. 

If you would like to edit the OER and export it e.g. to Word or PDF, you can do it in three ways. 

1. Edit `.html` files provided on Zenodo
2. Edit and render Quarto files

   First, clone the repository.
     - Open the file in R Studio, set the following line to your preferred format, e.g.: 
    ```         
    format: pdf
    ```
    And click `Render`.
    - Change the line as above using any text editor and use Quarto CLI to render it:
    ```         
    quarto render
    ```

### TODO list:

-   Provide solutions for Python (needs writing from scratch)
