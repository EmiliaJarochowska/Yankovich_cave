### How to use?

The instruction is provided in the `Instructions.qmd` [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) file. This is an open source publishing format based on markdown. You can preview the file in `Instructions.md` file in the same repository. Quarto files can be rendered to any format: `docx`, `pdf`, `html`. 

You can render the file in two ways. First, clone the repository.

The exercise can be completed in any reactive language that allows data manipulation: R, Python, Julia, etc.
